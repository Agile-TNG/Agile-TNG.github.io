[A:TNG](http://agiletng.org) is an initiative to re-open the community of
Agile practitioners that originally fostered
[XP](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap) to focus on the new
frontier of Agile at enterprise scale.

A:TNG is identifying the pattern languages contained in the branded frameworks
and augmenting them with patterns contributed by its community of Agilists
in the trenches. It will distributes this work via github under an open
content license to enable the community to curate and refactor all of these
patterns to evolve an Open Agile Pattern Language (“OAPL” pronounced "Opal").

## Conspiracy

Robert Heinlein said that inside every revolution there's a conspiracy. Some
conspiracies get on their high horses and call themselves founders. But our
fellows all put their pants on one leg at a time:

* Peter Merel
* Dave Geving
* Dave Martin
* Dave Bales
* Dries Louw

Soon we'll open the gates to all comers, and then it won't matter who kicked
this thing off because it will evolve over time in ways we can't possibly
anticipate. We hope you'll take part in that yourself.

For now if you're sympathetic and would like get involved, [please
fork](http://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io). We have a lot of work
to do just on the basics before we get the collaborative pattern authoring
flow going, but forking will help us feel we're not plumb loco here. And
forking is good for the soul.
