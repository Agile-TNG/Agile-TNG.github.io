[A:TNG](http://agiletng.org) is an initiative to re-open the community of
Agile practitioners that originally fostered
[XP](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap) to focus on the new
frontier of Agile at enterprise scale.

A:TNG is identifying the pattern languages contained in the branded frameworks
and augmenting them with patterns contributed by its community of Agilists
in the trenches. It will distribute this work via github under an open
content license to enable the community to curate and refactor these
patterns to form an [Open Agile Pattern
Language](http://agiletng.org/2014/03/09/oapl-the-open-agile-pattern-language/).

## Conspiracy

Robert Heinlein said that inside every revolution there's a conspiracy. Some
conspiracies get on their high horses and call themselves founders and try to
lead from the front. But our fellows believe in servant-leadership and put
their pants on one leg at a time:

* Peter Merel
* Dave Geving
* Dave Martin
* Dave Bales
* Dries Louw

Soon we'll open the gates to all comers, and it won't matter who kicked this
thing off because it will evolve over time in ways we can't possibly
anticipate. The Alliance should have done that at the start. We hope you'll
contribute ideas and feedback and take part in this revolution yourself.

If you're sympathetic, [fork](http://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io)
us on github. We have a lot of work to do just on the basics before we get the
collaborative pattern authoring flow going, but forking will help us feel
we're not plumb loco here. And forking is good for the soul.
