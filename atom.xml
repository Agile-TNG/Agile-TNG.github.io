    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why TNG?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.compelcon.se/gallery/XP2000/XP2000_A_037?full=1">stand-up in the
Med</a> that presaged
the famous Snowbird meeting was where <em>Extreme</em> became <em>Agile</em>.  That was
the beauty of it. Nothing was sacred and there was no need to pay our respect
to any great names. We were conspirators and it was a revolution.</p>

<p>If there were no Agile now we would just go and invent it again.
What was really great about those early days of the Alliance was there
was no one whose ring needed kissing and change could happen <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>So how is it that here in 2014 the Manifesto hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2001?  There
are conferences every year but it just stays the same. Have we learned nothing
in this time? Perhaps the Manifesto is a valuable historical document but this
doesn&rsquo;t quite &hellip;  Agile.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We all know the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/background.jpg">Agle Last Supper
picture</a>. The truth is there are
lots of agilists these days with more experience than the Snowbird guys had
back then. In the 20th century we&rsquo;d have cruised over to Ward&rsquo;s Wiki &ndash; when it
was the only wiki &ndash; to share what we were learning in the
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow">WikiNow</a>, that gestalt mind almost but
not entirely unlike Wikipedia. And the Manifesto would have kept evolving.</p>

<p>What happened to that first open Agile community? Believe it or not there was
actually a guy who spent the first decade of the 21st century <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GrammarVandal">correcting
grammar</a> on C2. Correcting it
<strong>wrong</strong>. He wasn&rsquo;t alone; there were lots of trolls. Strenuous efforts were
made to salvage C2 but it was in vain, because when the trolls moved in the
community moved on.</p>

<p>Now some of the original Alliance guys seem less interested in evolving
Agile in an open community and more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">playing police and wearing
badges</a>. There&rsquo;s no shortage of
new players acting like <em>federales</em> either, and the badge business is going
great. <strong>A:TNG</strong> is more about focusing on paydirt and sticking to your guns.</p>

<h2>What TNG?</h2>

<p>Consensus was what was most valuable about Ward&rsquo;s Wiki. Individuals and
interactions. On github now we can have that old time open Agile community back
and never mind about the trolls and sheriffs.</p>

<p>Here we can discover, refactor and evolve Agile patterns together again in a
<a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/NonZeroSumGame">Positive Sum Game</a>. Maybe even
get an <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileParliament">Agile Parliament</a> going.
Treaty proposals as pull requests &hellip; needs some thought and trial and error,
but then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. To advance the state of the Agile art.</p>

<h2>How TNG?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got work to do to give TNG form: pick a license, put up an initial
community charter, get the Parliament pattern to work online. brand a
logo, figure out how to change the framing content here, and send out
enough invitations to get a kernel community moving.</p>

<p>When we were kids we had sea monkeys. The instructions said to add the sachet
to the water, push the repo, and next morning it&rsquo;d be full of little people.
That&rsquo;s seems like a system metaphor for this.  Except maybe I&rsquo;m the brine
shrimp and you&rsquo;re the kid wondering when it&rsquo;ll start to look like the picture
on the packet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get stuck in. Star and fork the repo. Help figure the
protocol out. That ol&#8217; <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>
will kick in real soon &hellip;</p>
