[A:TNG](http://agiletng.org) is an initiative to re-open the community of
Agile practitioners that originally fostered
[XP](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap) to focus on the new
frontier of Agile at enterprise scale.

A:TNG identifies the state of the Agile art through patterns contributed by
its community of Agilists in the trenches. It will distribute this work via
github under an open content license to enable the community to curate and
refactor these patterns to form an [Open Agile Pattern
Language](http://agiletng.org/2014/03/09/oapl-the-open-agile-pattern-language/).

## A:TNG Fellows

Robert Heinlein said that inside every revolution there's a conspiracy.  We
aim to open the gates to all comers now so it won't matter who kicked this
thing off. If we do that right, A:TNG will evolve over time in ways we can't
possibly anticipate. We hope you'll contribute ideas and feedback to take
part in this revolution yourself.

If you're sympathetic, [fork](http://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io)
us on github. We have a lot of work to do just on the basics before we get the
collaborative pattern authoring flow going, but forking will helps us feel
we're not plumb loco here. And it's good for the soul.
