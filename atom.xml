    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why TNG?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.compelcon.se/gallery/XP2000/XP2000_A_037?full=1">stand-up in the
Med</a> that presaged
the famous Snowbird meeting was where <em>Extreme</em> became <em>Agile</em>.  That was
the beauty of it. Nothing was sacred and there was no need to pay our respect
to any great names. We were conspirators and it was a revolution.</p>

<p>If there were no Agile now we would just go and invent it again this way.
What was really great about those early days of the Alliance was there
was no one whose ring needed kissing and change could happen <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>So how is it that here in 2014 the Manifesto hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2001?  There
are conferences every year; have we learned nothing in all this time? Treating
the Manifesto is some historical document like the Declaration of Independence
doesn&rsquo;t seem quite &hellip; Agile.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We all know the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/background.jpg">Agle Last Supper
picture</a>. The truth is there are
lots of agilists these days with more experience than the Snowbird guys had
back then. In the 20th century we&rsquo;d have cruised over to Ward&rsquo;s Wiki &ndash; when it
was the only wiki &ndash; to share what we were learning in the
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow">WikiNow</a>, that gestalt mind almost but
not entirely unlike Wikipedia. And the Manifesto would have kept evolving.</p>

<p>What happened to that first open Agile community? Believe it or not there was
actually a guy who spent the first decade of the 21st century <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GrammarVandal">correcting
grammar</a> on C2. Correcting it
<strong>wrong</strong>. He wasn&rsquo;t alone; there were lots of trolls. Strenuous efforts were
made to salvage C2 but it was in vain, because when the trolls moved in the
community moved on.</p>

<p>Likewise some of the original Alliance members seem less interested in
evolving Agile in the open and more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">playing police and wearing
badges</a>. There are new players
acting like <em>federales</em> too, and the badge business seems to be booming.</p>

<h2>What is TNG?</h2>

<p>Agile was never about badges. It&rsquo;s about productive teams and their practice
patterns, using peer protocols to self-organise and metric feedback to guide
their evolution. The original Manifesto values are still relevant and
valuable, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t be refactored and adapted the same
way the original open community did. <strong>A:TNG</strong> is for that.</p>

<p>To advance the state of the Agile art we will discover, refactor and evolve
Agile patterns together in a <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/NonZeroSumGame">Positive Sum
Game</a>. Everyone can play. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve written a book, earned a badge or attended some
ancient standup. It only matters that you&rsquo;ve got relevant experience and
useful ideas now.</p>

<h2>How TNG?</h2>

<p>Consensus generation was the most valuable thing about Ward&rsquo;s Wiki.
Individuals and interactions in open collaboration generated lots of mutually
agreeable content. We might want this old time open Agile back and never mind
trolls and sheriffs &ndash; but how?</p>

<p>A wiki is basically an open version control system wedded to a content editor.
Most are centralized, which means people can only have one current version of
a wiki page at any one time. That&rsquo;s where the trolls and sherrifs came from.</p>

<p>Here on github we have a decentralized VCS as our basis for consensus
decisions. TNG can use this new technology as our way of self-organising. If
any trolls turn up we simply don&rsquo;t need to pull from them. And no more trolls
means no more need for sheriffs.</p>

<p>We could even get an <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileParliament">Agile
Parliament</a> going. Treaty
proposals as pull requests … that will take some doing. Needs trial and error,
but then that’s what we’re here for. To advance the state of our Agile art.</p>

<p>Sounds cool but we&rsquo;ve still got lots of basics to cover to give TNG form: pick
a license, put up an initial community charter, kick the Parliament pattern
around. figure out how to change the framing content here, figure out a
decenralized authoring workflow and send out enough invitations to get a
kernel community moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like, when we were kids, we had sea monkeys. The instructions said to add
the sachet to the water and next morning it&rsquo;d be full of little people.
That&rsquo;s our system metaphor for this. Except maybe I&rsquo;m the brine shrimp and
you&rsquo;re the kid wondering when it&rsquo;ll start to look like the picture on the
packet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get stuck in. Star and fork the repo. Help figure the
protocol out. That ol&#8217; <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>
will kick in real soon &hellip;</p>
