    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why is it that the Agile Manifesto hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2001?  There
are conferences every year. Have we learned nothing in all that time? Seeing
the Manifesto as a historical document like the Declaration of Independence
doesn&rsquo;t seem very Agile. Don&rsquo;t we embrace change around here?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.compelcon.se/gallery/XP2000/XP2000_A_037?full=1">stand-up in the
Med</a> that presaged
the famous Snowbird meeting was where <em>Extreme</em> became <em>Agile</em>.  That was
the beauty of it. Nothing was sacred and there was no need to pay our respect
to any great names. We were conspirators and it was a revolution.</p>

<h2>Why TNG?</h2>

<p>If  were no Agile today we would just go and invent it again this way.
What was really great about those early days of the Alliance was there
was no one whose ring needed kissing. So change could happen <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>We all know the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/background.jpg">Agle Last Supper
picture</a>. The truth is there are
lots of agilists these days with more experience than the Snowbird guys had
then.  In the 20th century we&rsquo;d have cruised over to Ward&rsquo;s Wiki &ndash; when it was
the only wiki &ndash; to share what we were learning in the
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow">WikiNow</a>, that gestalt mind almost but
not entirely unlike Wikipedia. And the Manifesto would have kept evolving.
What happened to the original open community that gave us Agile?</p>

<p>Believe it or not there was
actually a guy who spent the first decade of the 21st century <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GrammarVandal">correcting
grammar</a> on C2. Correcting it
<strong>wrong</strong>. He wasn&rsquo;t alone; there were lots of trolls. Strenuous efforts were
made to salvage C2 but in vain, because when the trolls moved in the
community moved on.</p>

<p>Similarly some of the original Alliance members seem less interested in
evolving the state of the Agile art and more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">handing out
badges</a>. There are some new
players acting like <em>federales</em> too, and these badge businesses seem to be
booming.</p>

<h2>What TNG?</h2>

<p>Agile was never about badges. It&rsquo;s about productive teams and their practice
patterns, using peer protocols to self-organise and metric feedback to guide
their evolution. The original Manifesto values are as relevant as ever,
but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they shouldn&rsquo;t be refactored and adapted the
same way the original open community did. <strong>A:TNG</strong> is for that.</p>

<p>To advance the state of the Agile art we are uncovering, refactoring and
evolving Agile patterns together in a <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/NonZeroSumGame">Positive Sum
Game</a>. Everyone can play. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not you&rsquo;ve written a book, earned a badge or
attended some ancient standup. It only matters that you&rsquo;ve got relevant
experience and ideas to contribute.</p>

<h2>How TNG?</h2>

<p>Consensus generation was the most valuable thing about Ward&rsquo;s Wiki.
Individuals and interactions in open collaboration generated lots of mutually
agreeable content. We might want this old time open Agile back and never mind
trolls and sheriffs &ndash; but how?</p>

<p>A wiki is basically an open version control system wedded to a content editor.
Most are centralized, which means you can only have one current version of
a wiki page at any one time. That&rsquo;s where trolls and sherrifs come from.</p>

<p>On github we have a decentralized VCS as our basis for consensus
decisions. TNG will use this new technology as its way of self-organising. If
any trolls turn up we simply don&rsquo;t need to pull from them. And no more trolls
means no sheriffs.</p>

<p>We could get an <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileParliament">Agile Parliament</a>
going. Treaty proposals as pull requests … that would take some doing. Needs
trial and error, but that’s what we’re here for. To advance the state of our
Agile art.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got lots of basics to cover to give TNG such a form: pick a license, put
up an initial community charter, kick the Parliament pattern around, figure
out how to collaborate on the framing content here, figure out a decenralized
authoring workflow and send out enough invitations to get our kernel community
moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like, when we were kids, we had sea monkeys. The instructions said to add
the sachet to the water and next morning it&rsquo;d be full of little people.
That&rsquo;s our system metaphor for this. Except maybe I&rsquo;m the brine shrimp and
you&rsquo;re the kid wondering when we&rsquo;ll start to look like the picture on the
packet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get stuck in. Star and fork the repo. Help figure the
protocol out. That ol' <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>
will kick in real soon &hellip;</p>
