Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece provides a great [system metaphor]() for
Enterprise Agile transformation and the fundamental of A:TNG's [Open
Agile Pattern Language]().

## Spoilers

You don't need to see the film to understand this pattern language but the
patterns necessarily involve spoilers for the film.  So we recommend you see
the film first.  The restored 207 minute version is freely available on
["iTunes"](http://thepiratebay.se/search/seven%20samurai/0/7/0) so from here
on we'll leave the matter of spoilers up to you.

## The Film and The Pattern Language

_The Seven Samurai_ concerns a defenceless village that hires a group of
down-at-heel samurai as protection from a horde of bandits. The samurais
transform the village into a force that destroys the bandits and takes
ownership of its own destiny. This transformation involves 9 distinct cycles
of activity which constitute the patterns in this pattern language.  

We've discussed the use of a pattern language [here](). We employ the
[Portland Form](http://c2.com/ppr/about/portland.html) for patterns in A:TNG
for its simplicity and ease of interlinkage.
