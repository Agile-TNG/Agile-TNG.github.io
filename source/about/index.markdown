[A:TNG](http://agiletng.org) started as an initiative to re-open the community of Agile practitioners that originally fostered [XP](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap) to foster a 3rd generation of Agile focusing on Agile organisations.

The idea was that A:TNG identifies the state of the Agile art through patterns contributed by a community of Agilists in the trenches. It distributes this work via github under an open content license to enable the community to curate and refactor these patterns to form an [Open Agile Pattern Language](http://agiletng.org/2014/03/09/oapl-the-open-agile-pattern-language/).

## A:TNG Fellows

Robert Heinlein said that inside every revolution there's a conspiracy. If we do this right, A:TNG will evolve over time in ways we can't possibly anticipate. We hope you'll step up and contribute ideas and feedback to take part in this revolution. But for now the main conspirators are:

* [Peter Merel](http://www.linkedin.com/in/petermerel) -- Originator of the XSCALE product/portfolio/transformation patterns. Also coach, trainer and editor in chief for A:TNG

* [Dave Geving]() -- Chargé D'Affaires Américains

* [Dave Martin]() -- Master at Arms and Brewing

* [The Masked Methodologist]() -- Our version of the Stig, his employer won't let him actually do this kind of work. But he knows who he is.

If you're sympathetic, [fork](http://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io) us on github. We're in a semi-permanent state of refactoring all this stuff so forking will helps us feel we're not going plumb loco. And it's good for the soul.
