The Akira Kurosawa masterpiece provides a great [system metaphor]() for
Enterprise Agile transformation and the fundamental of A:TNG's [Open
Agile Pattern Language]().

## Spoilers

You don't need to see the Kurosawa film to understand the the rest of this post
but the post necessarily involves spoilers for the film - which is to say,
information that will detract from your enjoyment when you see it.

As this is a truly great film we urge you to see it and not spoil it. The
restored 207 minute version is freely available on
["iTunes"](http://thepiratebay.se/search/seven%20samurai/0/7/0) so from here
on we'll regard any spoiling as your concern.

## The Film and The Pattern Language

_The Seven Samurai_ concerns a starving village in feudal Japan that hires a
group of down-at-heel samurai as protection from a horde of bandits.  The
samurais transform the village into a force that both destroys the bandits and
takes ownership of its own destiny.  

This transformation involves 9 distinct activities, which constitute the
patterns in this language.  We've discussed the concept of a pattern language
[here](). We prefer the [Portland Form](http://c2.com/ppr/about/portland.html)
in A:TNG because of its simplicity and ease of interlinkage. If you'd prefer a
different form of language, please let us know in the comments section on this
article.
