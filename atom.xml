    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why TNG?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.compelcon.se/gallery/XP2000/XP2000_A_037?full=1">stand-up in the
Med</a> that presaged
the famous Snowbird meeting was where <em>Extreme</em> became <em>Agile</em>.  That was
the beauty of it. Nothing was sacred and there was no need to pay our respect
to any great names. We were conspirators and it was a revolution.</p>

<p>If there were no Agile now we would just go and invent it again.
What was really great about the early days of the Alliance was there
was no one whose ring needed kissing and change could happen <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>So how is it that here in 2014 the Manifesto hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2001?  There
are conferences every year but it stays the same. Maybe it&rsquo;s a valuable
historical document but that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite &hellip;  Agile.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/background.jpg">Agle Last Supper
picture</a>. The truth is there are
lots of agilists these days with at least as much experience as the Snowbird
guys had then. In the 20th century we&rsquo;d all have cruised over to Ward&rsquo;s
Wiki &ndash; when it was the only wiki &ndash; to share what we learned in the
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow">WikiNow</a>, the gestalt mind almost but not
completely unlike Wikipedia. And Agile could have evolved some more.</p>

<p>What happened to the open Agile community? Believe it or not there was
actually a guy who spent the first decade of the 21st century <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GrammarVandal">correcting
grammar</a> on C2. Correcting it
<strong>wrong</strong>. He wasn&rsquo;t alone either. There were lots of trolls. Efforts were
made to salvage the place but ultimately it was in vain, because when the
trolls moved in our community moved on.</p>

<p>And some of those original Alliance guys seem less interested in progressing
the  open community and more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">playing police and wearing
badges</a>. There&rsquo;s no shortage of
new players wanting to act like <em>federales</em> either. <strong>A:TNG</strong> says there&rsquo;s
more paydirt if we practitioners just stick to our guns.</p>

<h2>What TNG?</h2>

<p>Consensus decision-making was what was most valuable about Ward&rsquo;s Wiki.
Individuals and interactions after all. And that&rsquo;s what TNG is really about.
On github we can have that old time open Agile community back and never mind
about the trolls and sheriffs. This whole jekyll think is more wiki than wiki.</p>

<p>Here we can discover, refactor and evolve Agile patterns together again in a
<a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/NonZeroSumGame">Positive Sum Game</a>. Maybe even
get an <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileParliament">Agile Parliament</a> going. I
think we could run that on github too &hellip; treaty proposals as pull requests
&hellip; needs some thought and trial and error, but then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here
for.</p>

<h2>How TNG?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got work to do to give TNG form: pick a license, put up an initial
community charter, get the Parliament pattern to work online. brand a
logo, figure out how to change the framing content here, and send out
enough invitations to get a kernel community moving.</p>

<p>When we were kids we had sea monkeys. The instructions said to add the sachet
to the water, push the repo, and next morning it&rsquo;d be full of little people.
That&rsquo;s seems like a system metaphor for this.  Except maybe I&rsquo;m the brine
shrimp and you&rsquo;re the kid wondering when it&rsquo;ll start to look like the picture
on the packet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get stuck in. Star and fork the repo. Help figure the
protocol out. That ol&#8217; <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>
will kick in real soon &hellip;</p>
