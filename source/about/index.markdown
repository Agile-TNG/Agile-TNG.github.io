[A:TNG](http://agiletng.org) is an initiative to re-open the community of
Agile practitioners that originally fostered
[XP](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap) to focus on the new
frontier of Agile at enterprise scale.

Agile started with XP on the [C2 Wiki](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki), a high
powered but open community of professionals sharing patterns and innovations
for the common good. The Agile Alliance distilled their work into a
Manifesto and added a signup page, but C2's open community is the real reason
for the global supremacy of Agile today.

Now the Agile Manifesto is showing its age. It lacks values relevant to large
scale Agile adoption, and this gap has led to contention as consultancies and
certificate-mills compete to pry open corporate checkbooks for their
respective brands.

[Agile: The Next Generation](http://agiletng.org) is an initiative to bring
the open agile community back together to focus on enterprise scale. We're not
cutting the cord to the old [c2.com](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?CategoryAgile)
collateral,
and we'll link promiscuously, but we've set up our headquarters where all
modern projects live: in a repository [on
github](https://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io).

To kick things off we boldly identify 4 values Agile needs at enterprise scale
beyond the original manifesto:

* **Pattern languages over prescriptive frameworks**  
* **Productive teams over certified individuals**  
* **Metric feedback over command & control**  
* **Consensus protocols over management hierarchies**  

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the
items on the left more.

To re-open the branded frameworks Agile:TNG is identifying the pattern
languages they contain and augmenting these with patterns contributed
by its open community of experienced Agile professionals. It will
distribute these via github under an open
content license to enable the community to curate and refactor them,
so forming an Open Agile Pattern Language (“OAPL” pronounced "Opal").

## To-Do

A:TNG is just getting organized. If you'd like to be added as
a contributor, [please
fork](http://github.com/Agile-TNG/Agile-TNG.github.io). We
have a lot of work to do just on the basics before we get some
content going.
