    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.compelcon.se/gallery/XP2000/XP2000_A_037?full=1">first Alliance
meeting</a> preceded
the famous Snowbird session by almost a year. Sardinia was where <em>Extreme</em>
became <em>Agile</em>. We don&rsquo;t agree on who said it first. It just happened.
Nothing was sacred and no one&rsquo;s ring needed kissing. We were conspirators and
this was a revolution.</p>

<h2>Why TNG?</h2>

<p>If there were no Agile today we would just invent it all over again, but we
probably wouldn&rsquo;t do it the same way. The Agile Manifesto hasn&rsquo;t changed since
2001. We&rsquo;ve learned a few things since then.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s seen the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/background.jpg">Agle Last
Supper</a> picture. With its beautiful
lighting the guys look a lot more credible than half-naked at that first
standup in the Med. Like some kind of saints. But the Mediterranean picture
has more truth. Fallible fellows trying to figure out something bigger than all
of them.</p>

<p>Iconography is important but of course we have lots of agilists these days with
more Agile experience than the Alliance had then. In the 20th century
we&rsquo;d all have cruised over to Ward&rsquo;s Wiki &ndash; when it was the only wiki &ndash; to
share what we&rsquo;re learning in the
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNow">WikiNow</a>, that gestalt mind almost but
not entirely unlike Wikipedia. And the Manifesto would have kept evolving.</p>

<p>What happened to the original open community that gave us Agile?  Believe it
or not there was actually a guy who spent the first decade of the 21st century
<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GrammarVandal">correcting grammar</a> on C2.
Correcting it <em>wrong</em>. He wasn&rsquo;t alone; there were lots of trolls. Strenuous
efforts were made to salvage C2, but in vain, because when the trolls moved in
the community moved on.</p>

<p>Also some of the original Alliance members became less interested in evolving
the state of the Agile art and more interested in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsdZKCh6RsU">selling
badges</a>. There seemed no harm in
that at first, but with new players getting in on the action and the
certification businesses booming, it&rsquo;s the opposite of the open spirit of the
Alliance.</p>

<h2>What TNG?</h2>

<p>Agile is about productive teams and their practice patterns, using peer
protocols to self-organise and metric feedback to guide their evolution. Not
badges. The original Manifesto values are as relevant as ever, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean they shouldn&rsquo;t be refactored and adapted over time the same way
the original open community did. <strong>A:TNG</strong> is for that.</p>

<p>To advance the state of the Agile art we are uncovering, refactoring and
evolving Agile patterns together in a <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/NonZeroSumGame">Positive Sum
Game</a>. Everyone can play. It
doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not you&rsquo;ve written a book, earned a certificate or
attended some ancient standup. It only matters that you&rsquo;ve got relevant
experience and ideas to contribute.</p>

<h2>How TNG?</h2>

<p>Consensus generation was the most valuable thing about Ward&rsquo;s Wiki.
Individuals and interactions in open collaboration generated lots of mutually
agreeable content. We might want this old time open Agile back and never mind
trolls and sheriffs &ndash; but how?</p>

<p>A wiki is basically an open version control system wedded to a content editor.
Most are centralized, which means you can only have one current version of
a wiki page at any one time. That&rsquo;s where trolls and sherrifs come from.</p>

<p>On github we have a decentralized VCS as our basis for consensus
decisions. TNG will use this new technology as its way of self-organising. If
any trolls turn up we simply don&rsquo;t need to pull from them. And no more trolls
means no sheriffs.</p>

<p>We could get an <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AgileParliament">Agile Parliament</a>
going. Treaty proposals as pull requests … that would take some doing. Needs
trial and error, but that’s what we’re here for. To advance the state of our
Agile art.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got lots of basics to cover to give TNG such a form: pick a license, put
up an initial community charter, kick the Parliament pattern around, figure
out how to collaborate on the framing content here, figure out a decenralized
authoring workflow and send out enough invitations to get our kernel community
moving.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like, when we were kids, we had sea monkeys. The instructions said to add
the sachet to the water and next morning it&rsquo;d be full of little people.
That&rsquo;s our system metaphor for this. Except maybe I&rsquo;m the brine shrimp and
you&rsquo;re the kid wondering when we&rsquo;ll start to look like the picture on the
packet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get stuck in. Fork the repo. Help figure the
protocol out. That ol' <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiNature">WikiNature</a>
will kick in real soon &hellip;</p>

    <updated>2014-03-10T09:43:28+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Agile-TNG.github.io/2014/03/10/4-new-values</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By working Agile and helping others do so we have come to value:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consensus games over accountable hierarchies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Extreme teams over corporate committees</strong></li>
<li><strong>Product funding over project budgets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adaptation patterns over prescriptive frameworks</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on
the left more. And while we honor the original Manifesto values, we honor these
TNG values equally.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What do those items on the left mean?</h2>

<p>The items on the right are familiar to us all. The items on the left have
a pleasant ring, but let&rsquo;s make some concrete examples to make them clear.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consensus games</strong> include <a href="">lean coffees</a>, <a href="">open spaces</a>,
<a href="">retrospectives</a>, <a href="http://agiletng.org/2014/04/02/iroquois-council/">agile
parliament</a> and other ways
for people to align understandings and make decisions together. Lean coffees
and open spaces do the former; retros and parliaments do the latter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extreme teams</strong> are autonomous cross-component cross-functional end-to-end
feature-based teams that self-organize via the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices">XP
rules</a> to optimize
quality, throughput, ROI and alignment of their value stream to its market.
They&rsquo;re extreme in that they consciously &ldquo;turn all the dials to ten&rdquo; to
capitalize on learnings and innovations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product funding</strong> means funding to continuously deliver the maximum ROI
features to improve a value stream, rather than chunking objectives,
timeframes and budgets arbitrarily into projects. It includes patterns
from <a href="">Beyond Budeting</a>, <a href="">Beta Codex</a>, and <a href="">Open Book Management</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptation patterns</strong> describe proven solutions to commonplace problems in
a collaborative context. Similar to design patterns for software, they were
pioneered in the initial description of XP and revived by Jim Coplien and
Ken Schwaber in their <a href="">ScrumPLOP</a> conference.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Where do these values come from?</h2>

<p>Agile started with XP on the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki/ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap">C2
Wiki</a>, a high powered
but open community of professionals sharing patterns and innovations for the
common good. The Agile Alliance distilled this work into a Manifesto and added
a signup page, but C2&rsquo;s open community is the real reason for the global
supremacy of Agile today.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that all happened last century and the Manifesto is showing
its age.  It&rsquo;s still right on when it comes to teams, but lacks values and
principles for large scale Agile adoption. This gap has led to
<a href="http://agile.dzone.com/articles/method-wars-scrum-vs-safe">contention</a> as
consultancies and certificate-mills compete to pry open corporate checkbooks
for their respective brands.</p>

<p>Which is crazy. There&rsquo;s value in both Scrum and SAFe, and no reason to think
you can&rsquo;t combine elements of both along with other frameworks. The value of
frameworks isn&rsquo;t in their brands and certificates, nor in adopting them as
prescriptions, but in adapting the practice patterns they contain.</p>

<p>Schwaber is correct in worrying about the danger of making &ldquo;half a cow and
half a fish&rdquo; when what we really want is dolphins. The question is, on what
basis do you go about the process of adaptation? How do you do it organically,
iteratively, and without tripping up at scale? To do that you need a clear set
of values and principles. And that&rsquo;s where A:TNG comes in.</p>

<p>A:TNG is based on the idea that SAFe, Less, DAD, APF, ETF, OBM, Beyond
Budgeting, Lean and on and on all provide useful adaptation patterns.  And
that there&rsquo;s a lot more to enterprise agility than all of them put together.
We&rsquo;ve augmented the Manifesto values not as a way to make yet another brand,
but as a basis for the work of pulling these pattern languages out of all the
brands and into the open where we can really sort out what works with what.</p>

    <link href="http://Agile-TNG.github.io/2014/03/09/oapl-the-open-agile-pattern-language/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-09T18:02:45+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Agile-TNG.github.io/2014/03/09/oapl-the-open-agile-pattern-language</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/oapl300.png"></p>

<p>A key activity within A:TNG is organizing an open pattern language to relate
learnings from Agile frameworks to the experiences of our practitioners.
What advantage can this pattern language offer over the original
frameworks? What benefit in a culture where practitioners already have Agile
certificates? Why is this a big deal for TNG?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Pattern Language</h2>

<p>The history of Agile is intertwined with the Design Patterns movement. The
first XP book was framed as a pattern language and while Scrum started as a
framework it is now <a href="http://www.scrumplop.org">reformulating as a pattern
language</a>.</p>

<p>Design patterns started with the great 20th century architect Chris Alexander.
Alexander described them this way: <em>Each pattern describes a problem which
occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of
a trusted solution to that problem</em>. Alexander&rsquo;s insight was that patterns
work together to generate an architecture as a <a href="http://www.jacana.plus.com/pattern/P0.htm">language of
design</a>.</p>

<p>Software engineers soon took Alexander&rsquo;s idea to a new level with the &ldquo;Pattern
Languages of Programs&rdquo; (<a href="http://hillside.net/conferences">PLoP</a>) conference
series, the best-selling &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; book <a href="http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/GofPatterns.aspx">Design
Patterns</a>, and Ward Cunningham&rsquo;s
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?PeopleProjectsAndPatterns">Portland Pattern
Repository</a> which also
became the first wiki, &ldquo;Ward&rsquo;s Wiki&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The success of wiki as a collaborative editing method may have distracted
people from the Pattern Language ideas at its core, but there are still PLoP
conferences every year and popular patterns are known and used by every
professional software engineer.</p>

<p>The key advantage of pattern languages is the empowerment of their users to
make decisions that would otherwise require trial and error or deep expertise.
Furthermore,</p>

<ul>
<li>patterns can be adapted and refactored to suit specific domains without
adopting the pattern language as a whole</li>
<li>patterns enable a process of adaptive design whereby each can by trialled,
added and substracted iteratively as forces in the domain are experienced</li>
<li>the efficacy of alternative patterns can be determined by comparative
studies in related domains, and thereby informed choices can be made.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Anti-Patterns</h2>

<p>The complement to the Design Pattern is the Anti-Pattern, which describes a
solution that fails to solve the problem it was intended to solve, or which
generates more problems.  You may think of anti-patterns as categories of bad
ideas, but another class of them has to do with short term thinking at the
expense of long term goals. This is rather more commonplace than the
conscious bad choices.</p>

<p>In particular in Martin Fowler&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Refactoring&rdquo;, he and Kent Beck
identify a short list of design problems they call &ldquo;code smells&rdquo;. The code
smells are not bugs &ndash; the code still works &ndash; but a form of design pollution
that makes bugs more likely to occur, and fixing bugs more difficult.</p>

<p>Code smells are often caused by taking shortcuts to get things to work.  As
such they&rsquo;re part of the Agile process. So Beck and Fowler emphasize that it&rsquo;s
not the smells themselves that constitute Anti-Patterns, but a lack of
systematic remediation of them through the critical Agile process of
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?RefactorMercilessly">refactoring</a>.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately commmonplace, even in teams that have most of the other
Agile fundamentals nailed down, to find that refactoring is neglected during
times of stress. Of course the less refactoring, the more frequent those
times. The same vicious cycle may occur at the scale of whole organizations,
and so we regard <em>Not Refactoring</em> an &ldquo;Enterprise Smell&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Enterprise Smells &amp; Enterprise Refactorings</h2>

<p>At the level of an Enterprise we don&rsquo;t commonly speak of bugs, but after Lean
we talk of wastes, stressors, irregularities and misalignments. The Lean
movement has produced a classification of the first three of these, and Lean
coaches conduct various practices aimed at reducing them. It is reasonable to
think of Lean as a process of refactoring at an enterprise level.</p>

<p>Lean has not introduced a vocabulary equivalent to that of our Agile
programmers, however, and A:TNG regards this an an opportunity to provide
benefit by filling a gap. As it is reasonable to draw analogies between the
design of an enterprise and the design of a computer program, we can lift each
of the Beck/Fowler code smells into the context of the enterprise without
thinking very hard:</p>

<ul>
<li>duplicated code corresponds with teams with duplicate RACI</li>
<li>long methods correspond with deferred feedback</li>
<li>large classes correspond with large teams or component based teams</li>
<li>too many parameters corresponds with part-time resourcing</li>
<li>and so on &hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>It may be that this is putting the cart before the horse. It would be better
to systematically catalogue enterprise smells and refactorings, and then see
what they have in common with those at a code level. This may form a key
activity of the A:TNG community, and a substantial part of the OAPL may be
devoted to the result. We aim to kick off this cataloguing activity as part of
our inaugural meeting on March 13 in Sydney.</p>

<h2>Pattern Languages over Prescriptive Frameworks</h2>

<p>The reason this value is so prominent in A:TNG isn&rsquo;t to do with Enterprise
patterns and anti-patterns so much as the tendency for enterprises on the
Agile journey to take the advice of experienced agilists for more than it&rsquo;s
worth.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to believe that someone with long experience will have a
valuable practice pattern language to share. It is not reasonable for a guru
to suggest that the patterns in their language are the best, the only, or the
ultimate solution to the problems they address. Outside of the corporate
sphere we regard someone making such claims not as a trustworthy counsellor,
but as a dangerous cult leader. Counsellors explain the key factors in making
decisions; they don&rsquo;t describe the one true path.</p>

<p>It is also reasonable for newcomers to Agile to adopt all the patterns from a
specific framework as their first objective.  As Alistair Cockburn pointed out
in his treatment of <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri">Shu-Ha-Ri</a>, an
Agile beginner at the Shu level is best advised to follow a single framework
slavishly because that&rsquo;s the only way to experience the behaviour of its
interlocking elements. This is why we say these frameworks have value.</p>

<p>While a framework forms a good starting point for practice, over time the
student develops sufficient understanding of the way the framework applies in
their environment to pass into the realm of &ldquo;Ha&rdquo;. Here reflection and
experimentation with variations and augmentation of the starting framework
becomes the key way to improve, and pattern languages yield their greatest
benefits as signposts along he way.</p>

<p>As the practitioner emerges into the realm of Ri they gain their own insights,
make their own discoveries and solve problems beyond the current state of the
art. And so they&rsquo;re faced with two alternatives. Create a framework of their
own to brand and market the benefit of their learnings, or add their patterns
into an existing pattern language so that other practitioners can test them
against their own experience and refactor them collaboratively. This is the
purpose of the OAPL.</p>

<h2><em>We Are Uncovering Better Ways &hellip;</em></h2>

<p>The latter course may not be so remunerative as the former &ndash; but it is more
Agile because it is more collaborative, more transparent, more scientific, and
more courageous. For this reason the original Agile Manifesto begins with the
words, &ldquo;We are uncovering better ways &hellip;&rdquo;. So does TNG, not out of a sense of
tradition, but because this work of uncovering better ways is our ongoing
mission.</p>

<p>We are uncovering better ways to deliver products and services by improving
our teams, enterprises and communities. And we represent and refactor these
better ways together as patterns in our OAPL. Thereby we make the trade-offs
clear so we can work with newcomers and help them find better ways for
themselves, without expecting them merely to follow in our footsteps.</p>
