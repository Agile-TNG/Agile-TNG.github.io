The Iroquois Confederacy used it for centuries on a larger scale than
any modern corporation <a href="">Agile Parliament</a> is how they did it.</p>

<p>The Iroquois Confederacy interoperated with European governance in North
America for two centuries. The two co-existed up to the American revolution,
and the Iroquois directly influenced the new American form of government.</p>

<p>Iroquois and American forms differ in that Iroquois society was based on
unanimity and reciprocity rather than democracy and ownership. Their nations
were made up of chains of autonomous tribes managed by a pattern of councils
and intermarriages rather hierarchies of accountable middlemen.</p>

<p>Collaborative agreements between the autonomous tribes were called treaties.
To take effect a treaty required ratification, not just by the people
attending a council, but by the groups they represented. As opposed to
European laws, continuous review of treaties was required to maintain their
effect.</p>

<p><a href="">Agile Parliament</a> is a distillation of the Iroquois treaty protocol. It
consists of an <a href="">Open Space</a> with <a href="">story-form treaties</a>, a decision-making
<a href="">Kanban</a> and reciprocal ratification by participant teams.</p>

<h2>The Pattern in Portland Form</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="">Open Space</a> is good for aligning understanding, but doesn’t achieve
alignment on decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Agile enterprises must continously adapt to market forces, technological
innovations and internal constraints. An enterprise needs an efficient way
to make decisions about how to respond to these changing forces.</p></li>
<li><p>Accountable hierarchies are the traditional Taylorist method for making
corporate decisions. Unfortunately they aren&rsquo;t continously adaptive and
frequently obstruct internal collaboration to maintain power relationships,
generating a whole <a href="">Anti-Pattern Language</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Retrospectives work well for consensus decisions on the scale of a scrum,
but don&rsquo;t scale. Scrum of Scrums doesn&rsquo;t represent a whole interdependent
team so SoS retros experience political anti-patterns including
polarization, compromise and power games.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly to Spotify, Iroquois society was structured as a matrix of
councils, not a hierarchy of accountables. Tribes grouped into longhouses,
similar to Spotify&rsquo;s squads, with ancestral and generational associations
connecting people in layers across the hierarchy. These cross-cutting clan
relationships work similarly to the Spotify chapters and guilds.</p></li>
<li><p>The Iroquois &ldquo;great peace&rdquo; lasted at least since 1400 and represented such a
sustainable and idyllic model that Europeans in North America including the
American founding fathers <a href="http://www.ratical.org/many_worlds/6Nations/EoL/chp8.html">regarded it as an
ideal</a>. The great
peace was maintained entirely by the method of unanimous consent to
reciprocal treaties.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Therefore,</strong></p>

<p>Use a game of unanimous consent to reciprocal treaties to enable teams within
enterprises and communities to make decisions together.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As in an Open Space, individuals propose item for discussion in turn. Voting
dots are used to amalgamate and prioritize items, and the law of 2 feet
enables everyone to contribute to all sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike an open space, individuals identify themselves as representatives of
teams attempting to arrive at decisions to deal with their common concerns.</p></li>
<li><p>Each parliamentary session is split into 3 rounds. In each round:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of just a conference backlog, employ a 6 column kanban to forge
treaties. As with any kanban, limit the amount of Work In Progress in
order to maximize total throughput. The columns of this kanban are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Team learnings that could be leveraged by the broader community (Smiley face)</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges a team can’t solve for itself (Red Flag)</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas for the improvement of more teams than just one (Question mark)</p></li>
<li><p>Treaty proposals that have gained unanimous consent of a session and
are ready for parliamentary review (Exclamation mark)</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals that have passed review and are ready for respective team
ratification at retrospectives (Circle) – initially empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals that have since previous parliamentary sessions been
unanimously ratified by all represented teams (Trefoil Knot).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each session attempts to either create or refine a specific output: a
treaty proposal:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Smiley face sessions try to come up with a treaty about how the
community can capitalize on a specific team learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Flag sessions try to come up with a treaty about how the community
can organize to solve a specific team&rsquo;s problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Question mark sessions review a specific treaty proposal to try to
find a way to refactor it and the passed treaties into a consistent
whole.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unanimity in each session is required before a treaty proposal is
defined as “ready for review” &ndash; moved into the Exclamation mark column.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s perfectly okay for session participants to horsetrade on conditions
and trade-offs that must be satisfied before a treaty can be passed. It&rsquo;s
also okay for a treaty proposal to suggest modification or cancellation of
some previously enacted treaty.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of each round there’s a discussion-free review. All that
round’s “ready for review” treaty proposals are read out and moved to the
Exclamation Mark column.</p></li>
<li><p>Now any participant can move an Exclamation mark proposal back into the
Question mark column, but by doing so that participant undertakes to run a
new session in the next round to try to sort out whatever is worrying them
about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals that are not moved back into the Question mark column by any
participant are regarded as passed and moved into the Circle column.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At the end of the parliament session, the circled treaties affect no one. A
circled treaty must be unanimously ratified by every team – it’s presented
at each respective team retro to be considered for testing and ratification
over the period between parliament sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Only treaties that are unanimously ratified by all members of all teams at
their retros are enacted by the parliament in its next session. These are
moved to the Trefoil Knot column at the start of the session.</p></li>
<li><p>There is nothing to prevent a smaller subset of teams meeting separately to
ratify on a treaty that only affects themselves.  Likewise teams that don&rsquo;t
represent themselves at a parliament aren&rsquo;t bound by treaties agreed there.
They may join a treaty in a subsequent parliament or they may agree to work
together by other means.</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams that decide to block a passed treaty &ndash; to prevent it going Unanimous
do so by turning up at the next parliament sessoin and moving it back to the
Question column. The parliament reviews the blocked treaty in due course as
it would any treaty proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Agile Treaties</h2>

<p>As to the form of a treaty, there&rsquo;s a wonderful collection of real historical
Iroquois treaties collected by Benjamin Franklin <a href="">here</a> derived from the
Iroquois &ldquo;Great Law of Peace&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://www.manataka.org/page135.html">http://www.manataka.org/page135.html</a> .</p>

<p>Despite idealization by the likes of Rousseau and Franklin, Iroquois laws had
glaring inconsistencies from the standpoint of a Rawlsian <a href="">Theory Of
Justice</a>. Privileging the five Iroquois nations over other tribes caused
inequities that eventually ended the rule of the confederacy. There
were also rules of &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t conform with modern notions, such as,</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If refusal steadfastly follows, the War Chief shall let the bunch of white
lake shells drop from his outstretched hand to the ground, and shall bound
quickly forward and club the offending chief to death".</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, Iroquois treaties seem to fit into <a href="">story normal form</a> adorned
with <a href="">Behavior Driven Development</a> scenarios. To bring them in line with
Rawls we&rsquo;d add these constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To observe the <a href="">VeilOfIgnorance</a>, no treaty is permitted to refer to a
specific individual or group of people by name. Instead the treaty must
refer to people and groups in terms of their roles in relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to preserve reciprocity, a treaty may not obligate individuals or
groups that have not unanimously agreed to take part in it. This is the
essence of the most famous of the Iroquois treaties, the <a href="http://www.wampumchronicles.com/tworowwampumbelt.html">2 row
wampum</a> that was the
basis of Gene Roddenberry&rsquo;s famous fictional concept of non-interference.</p></li>
<li><p>A treaty among a group of peers may not prevent the formation of a treaty
among some subset of them. Or if the peers are groups, some subset of their
members. This is what the Iroquois &ldquo;Great Law&rdquo; means when it says that each
of the members must still tend their own fire &ndash; that they keep their
respective autonomy. The only autonomy they ever surrender is by unanimous
consent to a treaty.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>&ldquo;Brightening The Chain&rdquo;</h2>

<p>The Iroquois used 3 metrics to describe the health of their tribes and
nations, which they called <strong>the Fire, the Path and the Chain</strong>. These devices
were encoded into the wampum belts that signified treaty proposals, council
occasions and agreements. The three metrics seem to apply equally well to
the state of health of Agile teams in a modern enterprises so we&rsquo;ll dig in
here in some depth.</p>

<p><strong>The Fire</strong> indicates the quality of internal self-organisation of a tribe or
guild.  Iroquois chiefs were charged with keeping the fire lit and the
fireplace clean in much the same way as Scrum Masters are charged with
keeping team meetings prompt and Lean black belts value the cleanliness and
order of a manufacturing workplace. When a tribe suffered attrition due to
warfare, marriage or aging, its fire was said to burn low, and this was a
matter for resolution at a &ldquo;Condolence Council&rdquo;, which was basically an
agreement among longhouses or tribes to re-balance their membership, territory
and/or resource profile.</p>

<p><strong>The Path</strong> indicated the channels whereby the tribal unit interacted with
its peers. Forest diplomacy entailed a regular cycle of meetings involving
treaties, condolence, trading, inter-marriage and reciprocal gift-giving known
as &ldquo;potlatch&rdquo;.  This last being very similar to modern conferences, lean
coffees, open spaces and meetups. A commonplace subject of treaties occurred
when a tribe&rsquo;s <em>path</em> was obstructed by physical or political barriers,
including but not limited to the movement of tribal borders through warfare.</p>

<p><strong>The Chain</strong> indicated the external integrity of relations between a tribal
unit and its peers. Unlike modern legal systems, Iroquois treaties were held
to naturally decay over time, requiring continuous re-appraisal, refactoring
and re-affirmation to maintain their effect. Treaty relations that had decayed
were said to have rusted, where those still in force were iron, and those
recently re-affirmed were silver. Under conditions of disruptive market
change, technological innovation and internal refactoring, it is a given that
enterprises should revisit their internal assumptions and agreements in a
similar way, and this is the intent of the Agile Parliament pattern.</p>

<p>The chain began with a single family. Faced with an unforgiving environment,
Iroquois families could not be maintained in the isolated, nuclear form with
which we&rsquo;re most familiar in the West. Instead they took the form of line
marriages where a series of exogamous marriages among adults drawn from
different lineages occupied a single dwelling called a longhouse, an
arrangement Robert Heinlein explores in his &ldquo;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While the Spotify model draws on this tradition, the Iroquois were more formal
about chain structuring than Spotify, with each tribe forming a link with two
peers modeled after the row of families in the Longhouse.</p>

<p>Brightening the Chain therefore began at the level of a single tribal unit,
then a council involving two further tribal units. Thus chains brightened
by councils occurring at all levels, with each level maintaining pure autonomy
from the one above it, as limited only by treaties.</p>

<h2>The Parliament of Github?</h2>

<p>An obvious question is how this kind of system can be enacted in a modern
online social network, specifically github. It is fair to think of a github
pull-request as a treaty proposal, but there is no equivalent of a
parliamentary system on github today. Instead collaborators either work
together in a single repository, effectively functioning as a single tribe, or
assemble a feudal hierarchy of forks, sometimes hubbing on one base, or in
larger projects constituting an informal management hierarchy.</p>

<p>Work is going on within the Agile:TNG group to create a protocol, eventually
to be automated, whereby a system of branches can represent the different
states in the Parliamentary kanban, with a central repository pulling from
forks as governed by the parliamentary protocol described above.</p>

<p>A key challenge to be surmounted in effecting this is the protocol to
apply to the distinction between a fork and a collaborator where the latter
signifies a trusted and invited party but the former may represent an
untrusted, uninvited or even inimical one.</p>

<p>In general github, as a do-ocracy, provides straightforward social methods for
participants to cross from the status of fork to collaborator, but it remains
to arrange a parliamentary protocol that uses this as a channel.</p>
